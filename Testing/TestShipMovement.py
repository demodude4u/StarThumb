# - Not going for realism
# - Heavier ship => slower response
# - Feel slippery to drift tactically
# - Turning delay
# - Control cardinal directions
# - Lateral braking increased when releasing drift
# - Small ship should feel very precise and quick to circle opponents
# - Switch to faster cruise mode after heading in the same direction for a longer time
